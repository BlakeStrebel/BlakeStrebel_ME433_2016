Android Camera App:

Camera analyzes concentration of red and green pixels to determine center of brown line on green background. App contains one slider bar which allows the threshold to be adjusted.
The calculated center of mass (COM) is sent to the PIC at around 15-20 Hz. For this robot, the COM data for only one row of pixels was necessary for good control.

PIC Racer Code:

The PIC recieves the COM value from the app over via usb. Each time a new value is recieved, the PIC ajusts the PWM values for the left/right motor. If the COM value is in the center
of the screen, PWM is set to 100%; otherwise, COM values corresponding to right turns cause linearly decreasing PWM in the right motor and vice versa. Using this method, at least one of
the motors was always kept at 100% PWM.
